# Insufficient Error Handling in Express.js Application

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling.  The example code fetches user data from a database but fails to gracefully handle errors such as database connection issues or invalid user IDs.

## Problem

The provided Express.js route `/users/:id` retrieves user data from a database.  However, it only handles the case where no user is found (404).  It lacks robust error handling for scenarios like:

* **Database errors:** Connection failures, query errors, etc.
* **Invalid user ID:** Non-numeric IDs, IDs that do not conform to the database schema.
* **Other exceptions:**  Unexpected errors during data processing.

The current implementation merely logs errors to the console and returns a generic error message to the client, which is unhelpful for debugging and provides no details about the nature of the problem.  Furthermore, logging sensitive information to the console poses a security risk.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to implement comprehensive error handling to address these issues.  It includes:

*   **Centralized error handling middleware:**  Handles errors consistently across the application.
*   **Specific error handling for database queries:**  Checks for errors and handles them appropriately, providing informative error messages.
*   **Input validation:**  Checks for valid user IDs to prevent database errors.
*   **Avoid logging sensitive data:**  Uses a logger that prevents exposing sensitive information.
*   **HTTP status codes:** Uses appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 for server errors, 400 for bad requests) to communicate the nature of the problem to the client.
